## Theoretical exercise

Your answer goes here

## Practical exercise

Unless stated otherwise, your answer to the practical part should include the following elements:

-   Description of the aim of the simulation study.
-   Description of the different quantities that intervene in your simulation study. Explain how these quantities (fixed or random) are defined and the reasoning behind the choices you made.
-   Description of your findings using appropriate graphics and/or tables (with a caption!) that are well commented in the text.

The code should not appear in the PDF report, unless there is a specific reason to include it.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Your code goes here. 
# The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
# The programming language can be changed to Python or Julia
